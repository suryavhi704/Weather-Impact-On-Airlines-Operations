# Weather Impact on Flights Operation Dashboard ✈️🌦️

# 📖 Overview

This project analyzes the impact of weather conditions on flight operations by studying flight delays, cancellations, and customer satisfaction. Using real-world-like flight operation data, the project highlights how adverse weather disrupts flight schedules, impacts traveler experience, and affects airline efficiency.

The project dashboard (built with visualization tools) presents an end-to-end analysis with key KPIs, insights, and interactive visualizations.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Airlines often face operational challenges due to weather disruptions. These delays and cancellations not only reduce on-time performance but also lower customer satisfaction and increase financial losses. Understanding the extent of weather impact on flights is critical for airlines to improve resource planning, enhance customer communication, and minimize losses.

# 📊 Key Insights from Dashboard

Total Flights Analyzed: 2,281

Flights with weather impact: 326

Average Delay: 10.7 minutes per weather-impacted flight

On-Time Rate: Only 81% when weather impact occurs

Weather-Related Cancellations: 16 flights (≈4.91%)

No-Show Impact: 6.4% of passengers didn’t show up due to weather disruptions

Customer Satisfaction:

No Weather Impact: 7.0/10

Weather Impact: 6.8/10

Travel Purpose & Weather Effect: Business travelers had the highest no-shows, followed by family & emergency trips.
